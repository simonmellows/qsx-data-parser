# QSX Data Parser
 
This SIMPL Sharp module reads in a CSV-formatted Lutron QSX Integration report from a processor and parses the data to output Hrefs and label info associated with the Lutron components.

Currently the only CCI compatible CCI modules are:
- Zone control
- Button control
- LED control
